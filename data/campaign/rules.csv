Fleet maneuvers on such a scale is a spectacle in the sector. Sub-fleets and scout groups extended as far as three light-years away. On the first day, fighting went well, with battles fought on four battlefields, and the Hegemony's advance force suffering a severe defeat, reducing one of their battleships to near scrap metal,

On the second day, fighting was accompanied by a military revolt. He led the mutineers in an axial jump, quickly disengaging from the battlefield and firing a surge to jam communications before the upper echelons could react. The situation deteriorated rapidly, and the right flank collapsed. At great cost, we were able to escape, leaving the glory of the Valkyries behind, along fleet superiority.
