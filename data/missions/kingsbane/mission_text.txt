A battle broke out between the {Valkyrie} and {Blackrock Drive Yards}, who could not tolerate the inferior race sneaking around their high-tech mining fleet copying their technology.

VKS {Exile}, a {Valkyrie} super battleship, sat behind the front line, maintaining morale and providing protection for the fleet.

However, the decision makers of the {Valkyrie} were unaware that the other side hired mercenaries to target this giant ship. Once VKS {Exile} went out the reach of their main force, this mercenary fleet would attack and clip the wings of the {Valkyrie}.

VKS {Exile} was in good shape, and had a not fully prepared escort fleet with strong firepower. Both sides entered combat brimming with confidence.
