Location: Planetary orbit near Heaven's Gate
Date: 213.04.02

{Heaven's Gate} is located on the outskirts of the {Valkyrie's} system, a natural wormhole in a metastable state.

In the early days of the sector, this short-distance channel served as an economic engine to drive the expansion of the mining empire in the region, but with the Great Collapse, famine and unending deflation caused the collapse of the giant companies that had entrenched themselves here. Soon after, the wandering {Valkyries} stepped in and gained control.

In several military campaigns related to the {Atlantis Nebula}, {Heaven's Gate} revealed itself to be of great strategic value. Rivalry with other powers forced the {Valkyries} to maintain large fleets, in order to keep a firm grip on the wormhole while ensuring that they would not be outmatched in foreign wars. The planetary orbital base fleet controlled by the regional governor of the {Heaven's Gate} and the Royal Fleet that guarding the Enigma system accounted for 60% of military expenditures.

……

As times changed and modernization of the antiquated military organization overwhelmed national reserves, this fragile balance was strained by a rebellion that caused a financial crisis that intensified tensions between the military, the government, and the civilian population, culminating in a massive civil War.

Troops stationed in various places were recalled one after another, and the space marshals of the {Hegemony}, keenly aware of the gaps in the {Valkyries'} border defenses, deployed a large number of fleets and mercenaries to challenge the {Valkyries} in multiple locations. While most of the attacks were repulsed within three days, a {Hegemony} war fleet that was hidden by the barrage of full-frontal assaults struck directly at {Heaven's Gate}.

Having just ended the civil war, the new queen was still sailing through hyperspace in her flagship, and she issued an order to retreat, requiring the governor of {Heaven's Gate} to abandon the stronghold and join the decisive battle line planned by the royal family.

The governor firmly rejected this order, and choose to defend the glory of the {Valkyrie} and preserve the ancient privileges of the {Heaven's Gate} region to be independent of the royal family. Although the ambitions of the Hegemony were thwarted, the governor died in battle, and the Heaven's Gate region, which had lost most of its military power, was eventually swept away by the end of the modernization period. Royal Edict #12: The Heaven's Gate governor's district is thereby abolished, along with any local tax privileges, economic funding and self-governance regulations, and the Second Royal Guard and the Planetary Garrison Fleet will thereafter be responsible for the defense of the region.
