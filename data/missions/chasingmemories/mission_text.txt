Kanako, was a very pretty captain. She was dismissed and given life imprisonment because she was disgusted at the cruelty of the Valkyries.

The female captain, who was born a foot soldier, quickly escaped from prison and fled to the shuttle port. There, she hid in a container loaded on a tractor-trailer which made its way to the Naval Assembly Plant.

As luck would have it, she found an Nirvana Mk.II class on the production line and fled the Valkyrian space station.幸运之神的眷顾总是来得那么及时，她将成品线上的极乐天堂 MK.II级据为己有并离开了{瓦尔基里}空间站。

The prison break did not escape the eyes of the patrol team, and several patrol ships on perimeter watch were ordered to follow her. The veteran captain shifted the flagship to low power drive with skillful techniques, and dove into a nebula to hide sensor signature and engine traces.

However, the Jenova frigate, with its advanced sensors, locked on to the source of anomalous emissions......

Will she be able to escape?
