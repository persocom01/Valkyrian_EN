After the alien mothership was destroyed, the Valkyries had been very quiet. Their assembly lines at their docks were all shut down, a large number of workers and equipment were diverted to logistics, with their transportation destination yet unclear.

The space marshal in charge of the area on the {Hegemony} side frowned, realizing that things were not as simple as they seemed.

Indeed, things were not so simple.

Noticing the {Valkyrie's} unusual behavior, the marshal increased his reconnaissance efforts. Despite the fact that the forces under his jurisdiction were in a passive defense phase after several rounds of significant drawdowns, the frequency of reconnaissance and probing was still maintained at wartime levels.

Several months later, a small group of {Hegemony} strike forces detected an abnormally large super battleship in the wreckage area. Various observations indicated that construction was nearing completion.

The {Hegemony} immediately mobilized any main combat ships that remained on the front line against the Valkyrie to carry out an annihilation mission. However, when they arrived, they were met with a "warm welcome" by this behemoth and her support fleet.

It was like hellfire straight from the gates of hell.
