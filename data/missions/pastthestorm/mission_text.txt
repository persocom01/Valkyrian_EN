You are ordered to take command of a medium Valkyrian carrier formation to wipe out the enemy.

According to the radar, the enemy fleet is vast, lead by is 3 lumbering offensive ships. You panic for a moment, but upon further inspection, the enemy does not seem to have any carriers.

A slight curl turns up the corners of your mouth, and you know what you have to do.
