The newly developed {VKS} Valkyria {Yoshura} Mk.II class was just launched, with her maiden voyage destined for the front lines in the Ophiuchus system. However, after being affected by a suspected jump jammer, Valkyria and her escort detachment were forced to exit hyperspace.

Unfortunately, they jumped right into the center of a large pirate fleet, with hundreds of ships flying red skull flags circling a pirate base.

The commander of the escort fleet issued clear instructions: half of the warships were to form a circular line to drive away the pirate ships, and the rest were to evacuate with the escort target. But in a heroic move, the captain of VKS {Valkyria} ordered the flagship to perform a tactical maneuvers with maximum thruster output, rather than switch to long-distance travel mode.

The VKS {Valkyria} advanced straight ahead, breaking away from the retreat formation. The commander was forced to terminate sustained burn and order his ships to maintain sufficient distance to intervene in the battle.

The entire retreat formation turned around and rushed to the left wing of the pirate fleet.整个撤退编队都调转过头冲向了海盗舰队的左翼。

They were forced to defend everything they had.
