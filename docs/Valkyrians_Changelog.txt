- If you think that some of the weapons from the old days feel to strong or to weak for todays standards, please speak up.

- Changed projectile for Ether Driver, you can actualy see where it shots now.
- More than halved the ammo on Ether Driver, because of its very impressive range of 1350SU, perfect accuracy and its ability to ignore shields.
